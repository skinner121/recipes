        <h2>Directions</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li><br>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. 
                <br>Fry potatoes in hot oil until lightly browned, about 3 to 5 minutes. 
                <br>Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside.</li><br>
            <li>Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. 
                <br>Add onions, garlic, and fresh ginger; cook and stir until onion is soft and golden. 
                <br>Add tomatoes, salt, cumin, chili powder, pepper, and turmeric; cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes.</li><br>
            <li>Stir in yogurt, mint, ground cardamom, and cinnamon stick. 
                <br>Cover and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are cooked to a pulp. 
                <br>It may be necessary to add a little hot water if mixture becomes too dry and starts to stick to the pan.</li><br>
            <li>Add chicken and stir well to coat. 
                <br>Cover and cook over very low heat until chicken is tender, 35 to 45 minutes. 
                <br>There should only be a little very thick gravy left when chicken is finished cooking. 
                <br>If necessary cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the gravy.</li><br>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the rice: Wash rice well and drain in a colander for at least 30 minutes.</li><br>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet. 
                <br>Add onion; cook and stir until golden. 
                <br>Add cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, ground ginger, and saffron; stir in rice until coated with spices.</li><br>
            <li>Heat stock and salt in a medium pot until hot; pour over rice and stir well.</li><br>
            <li>Add chicken mixture and potatoes; stir gently to combine. Bring to a boil.</li><br>
            <li>Reduce heat to very low, cover with a tight-fitting lid, 
                <br>and steam for 20 minutes without lifting the lid or stirring.</li><br>
            <li>Spoon biryani onto a warm serving dish.</li><br>
          </ol>
