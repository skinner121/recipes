    Dhokla is a savoury and spongy steamed cake made from gram flour (besan), originating from <br>
    Gujarat, India. Here's a basic recipe:<br>
    
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    
      <ul>
        <li>1 cup gram flour (besan)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon baking soda (optional)</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon fruit salt (Eno)</li>
        <li>Oil for greasing.</li>
      </ul>
      
    For the tempering:
    
      <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds</li>
        <li>1 green chili, finely chopped (optional)</li>
        <li>A few curry leaves.</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Chopped coriander leaves (cilantro) for garnish.</li>
      </ul>
    
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    
    <ol>

      <li>Prepare the batter:
      In a large bowl, whisk together the gram flour, water, lemon juice, sugar, salt, and <br> 
      turmeric powder until smooth and lump-free. <br>
      Cover the bowl and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li><br>

      <li>Add leavening agent: <br>
      Just before steaming, add the baking soda (if using) and fruit salt (Eno) to the batter <br>
      and mix gently until incorporated. Do not overmix as this can affect the sponginess of <br>
      the dhokla.</li><br>

      <li>Steam the dhokla: <br>
      Grease a baking dish or plate with oil.<br>
      Pour the batter into the greased dish, spreading it evenly.<br>
      Place the dish in a steamer with enough water and bring it to a boil.<br>
      Steam the dhokla for 10-15 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the centre comes <br>
      out clean.</li><br>

      <li>Prepare the tempering:<br>
      While the dhokla is steaming, heat oil in a small pan over medium heat.<br>
      Add mustard seeds and let them splutter.<br>
      Add green chili (if using) and curry leaves, and saut√© for a few seconds.<br>
      Pour in the water, sugar, and salt.<br>
      Let the water simmer for a minute.</li><br>

      <li>Assemble and serve:<br>
      Once cooked, remove the dhokla from the steamer and let it cool slightly.<br>
      Cut the dhokla into squares or desired shapes.<br>
      Pour the hot tempering over the dhokla.<br>
      Garnish with chopped coriander leaves and serve hot with green chutney or any desired <br>
      chutney.</li><br>
 
    </ol>
    
    Tips:
    
        For a fluffier dhokla, use self-rising gram flour (besan) if available.<br>
        If the batter is too thick, add a little more water to thin it out.<br>
        You can adjust the amount of lemon juice, sugar, and salt to your taste.<br>
        Dhokla can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.<br>
    
    Enjoy your delicious homemade dhokla!<br>
